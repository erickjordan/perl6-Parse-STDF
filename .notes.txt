BUGS
----
Parse::STDF was developed and tested using Perl 6.c, Rakudo version 2015.12-199-g5ed58f6 built 
on MoarVM version 2015.12-29-g8079ca5.  There is a bug (see <https://rt.perl.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=127144>)
which impacts some of the class attributes typed as `uint8`.  Until this bug is fixed, workarounds may be needed.
See **examples/summary.p6** on how to do this.

When this bug is fixed following files must be updated:
 - examples/summary.p6
 - t/12-pcr.t
 - t/06-mir.t

PERFORMANCE
-----------
Perl6 is painfully slow.  Waiting for a faster version before making a formal release.

RUNNING EXAMPLES
